# Vimeo React Sample

This repository contains the code for my responses to Vimeo's Front End Engineering Intern coding sample.

## Installation & Set up

1. First, clone this repository onto your local system
2. CD into the `vimeo-react-sample` folder then run `yarn install` to install the required packages
3. Run `yarn start` which should open up `localhost:3000` in your browser. There you should be taken to a landing page to links to the Layout and Carousel exercise solutions
4. Go to `localhost:3000/layout` to see my solution to the layout exercise
5. Go to `localhost:3000/carousel` to see my solution to the carousel exercise

## Note from the Author

I developed this using some of the latest CSS3 and HTML5 technologies available like FlexBox, image masks, transitions, etc. I understand that not all browsers will be able to display this properly but for the sake of time, wrote the code using the technologies I knew could get the job done. Here are some ways to potentially improve the compatibility with other browsers:

* Use Polyfill libraries to increase the compatibility with older browsers
* Use 3rd party CSS frameworks like Bootstrap
* Browser specific prefixes

My reasoning for not doing some of these practices is because I wanted to prove that I could write this HTML/CSS from scratch with minimal external resources. I tested both pages on Safari and Chrome and used tools like https://www.responsinator.com/ to see how the pages looked like on different browser sizes.
